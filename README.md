# Objectives

This board, controlled by an atXmega should be able to control 5 servomotors,
one for each finger of a [robotic hand](http://inmoov.fr/hand-and-forarm/).
The microcontroller should be able to set both the current and the angle for
each servo.

What is more everything should be battery powered and commands can be sent via a
WiFi link and through an USB port.

A programmer is included within the board for easy firmware upgrade.
